&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux File System&lt;/strong&gt;
All files and diectories including OS directories and files in Linux are under the root directory (/)
ls / will list of them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the common root level directories are
/bin
/sbin
/boot
/dev
/etc  - configuration files
/home - user files will be in the sub directories in this folder
/lib  - software library
/root - root user’s files
/usr  - additional binaries
/var  - logs, cache etc
/proc
/dev
/sys&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;few commands&lt;/strong&gt;
pwd or echo $PWD - command which displays the current (present) working directory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;env - displays all environment variables&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| - pipe redirects the output of the command to the next command
eg: env | less (less is a file reader which will display data page by page)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;myval=5 (no space in between. This will assign 5 to myval in that bash shell)
export myval=5 will set the value for all child shells also&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;history - displays last run 1500 commands
timedatectl - displays the current time zone used by machine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;man &lt;command&gt; - to get help use manualpages
or wget —help
info - to get the info for all installed utilities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;package managers&lt;/strong&gt;
debian based (ubuntu, mint and kali) - apt (online)/dpkg(local)
rhel/fedora/centos - yum or dnf(online) / rpm (local) - dnf will eventually replace yum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;desktops&lt;/strong&gt;
cinnamon / mate
kde
gnome (ubuntu uses it)
user can install and easily switch between any of these desktops&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you on windows? Want to quickly try these?&lt;/strong&gt;
Pull an ubuntu image and run it
docker run -it ubuntu bash (prefix winpty if you are using Git Bash on windows)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when a new terminal is opened, a new shell is formed using a hidden file in home directory called .bashrc
its in home/user
for root
its in /root folder
if you want to changeany shell values, this is one of the files to edit
this .bashrc file is applied to only non login shell
login shell is when you use ssh login to login. this uses .profile file and some other files. .profile uses.bashrc values as well/. .profile is also in the same location as .bashrc
there is a profile file in /etc also&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there are other shells also like ksh, sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to find pout the shell defaulty allocated,
check the passwd file in /etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ls -a or ls —all   =&gt; list all files including hidden =&gt; . means file is hidden
ip add (ip is the command addr argument gets the ip address or you can use ip a)
ls -l (list all propertieties
ls -l /filelocation
combine commands ls -ltr
command line shortcuts
use tab for auto complete&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;type cd from anywhere and you will be back to your home directory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;touch file1 file2 file3 - creates new files
rm *
removes all file sin dir&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;backslash - escapa character
touch this\ is\ my\ file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mkdir folderame&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;new file creation
nano file1
ctrl+x  =&gt; y for save&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;touch filename to create empty file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;copy file
cp file1 dirname
cp file* dirname&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;questionmark for single digit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mv - move
. or ./ current dir
.. or ../ previous dir&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rmdir to remove diretcory - directory shud be empty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;searcj the files
locate command
locate ‘string’  (run sudo updatedb to get recent files also)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;less filename - prints a page a t a time
head - only 10 lines
tail last&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pipe
cat filename | grep string &gt;&gt; newfilenae&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;append
replace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nano filename&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;wc - wordcount &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;standard stream
standard in - stdin - 0
stdout - 1
stderr -2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;redirection
mysql -u root -p &amp;#x3C;password.txt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;echo Hello &gt; newfile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;working with archives
in liux -&gt; tar is the archival mechanism
most files are .tar.gz
.tar tar archive
.gz tells its compressed  using gzip also&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to unpack
tar xzf &lt;filename&gt;
x = xtract
z = zipped
f - filename is following &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tar czf newarchive.tar.gz foldernametocompress
c  create&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2 steps archive
tar cf
and then
gzip tar file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;network
install iproute2 package if ip command not working
ip route show

&lt;p&gt;dns
map numeric ip addresses to human readabale addresses
for that db would be needed and dns servers maintain that mapping&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to check if dns is reachable from my machine..use host commadn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;install host
host google.com
google.com has address 172.217.12.142

&lt;p&gt;use this file to se your own domain names&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;remote connections and ssh
openssh - provides capabilities for ssh as well as security (session encryption)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hot to do ssh
ssh username@ipassres
then type password when propted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;login using keypair to an amazon server / aws instance
ssh -i .home/mykey.pem username@ipaddress&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scp
securely copy
scp - securely copy file between machine
scp localfilelocation username@ipaddress:remotefilelocation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;linux scription / bash scripting
names will be like myfile.sh
sh is not necessary thiugh..its just to identify script file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;first line of the script file is to tell linux that its a script file and which shell interpreter has to be used&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;!/bin/bash  -(actual location of the bash interpreter)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this line is called shebang (read as shbang)
decalre -i number1 (integer is -i)
read number1  (wait for user input)
exit 0 (to exit) (not necessary)
use $number1 to access the actual value&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;chmod +x filename.sh  (to make it executable)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how to run run
./filename.sh&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Beginnings]]></title><description><![CDATA[Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and

Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named
Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This however showed weasel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well uncritical so misled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is very interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodness much until that fluid owl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the &lt;strong&gt;Italic Mountains&lt;/strong&gt;, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown &lt;em&gt;Bookmarksgrove&lt;/em&gt;, the headline of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Alphabet Village&lt;/a&gt; and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Longe and Parole&lt;/a&gt; and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So baboon this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mounted militant weasel gregariously admonishingly straightly hey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dear foresaw hungry and much some overhung&lt;/li&gt;

question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word “and” and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
return to its own, safe country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that “despite its name, salted duck eggs can also be made from
chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the
egg yolk will be less rich.”?
