description: Pulling some information from IBM Rational Team Concert (RTC) or currently EWM from nodejs environment.

IBM EWM (formerly IBM RTC) is a change and configuration management tool from IBM. It provides capabilities like 
issue tracking or work item management (like Jira for example), source code management (like GitHub), Build capabilities, planning capacility etc.

How do you pull some data out of RTC?

IBM provides different mechanisms to do that. Lets examine all the possibile alternatives and different use cases.

* OSLC REST API
* Reportable Rest API
* Source Control Management Command Line
* Plain Java API

The technology stack we are cosiderning here is non Java or to be precise node.js
For a Java environment, plain java API might be the best choice (but we are not discussing it here)
