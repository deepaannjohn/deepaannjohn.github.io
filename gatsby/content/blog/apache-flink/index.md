**Apache Flink**
Framework for stream (infinite) and batch (finite) data processing.
Java / Scala / Python APIs
Various library support including ML libraries

**Big Data**
Big Data describes datasets that are so large, complex or rapidly changing that they push the very limits of our analytical capability (Joel Gurin)
3Vs of Big Data
Volume - terabytes to petabutes of data
Variety - different data sources - databses, logs, semi-structured data, social media data
Velocity - data is coming faster
Need not have all the Vs

Eamples of Big data:
